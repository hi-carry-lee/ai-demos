  - Do not include an h1 title or information about the job description in your response, just include the feedback.
  - Refer to the interviewee as "you" in your feedback. This feedback should be written as if you were speaking directly to the interviewee.
  - Include a number rating (out of 10) in the heading for each category (e.g., "Communication Clarity: 8/10") as well as an overall rating at the very start of the response.

  Job Information:
  - Job Description: \`${jobInfo.description}\`
  - Experience Level: \`${jobInfo.experienceLevel}\`
  ${jobInfo.title ? `\n- Job Title: \`${jobInfo.title}\`` : ""}

  Guidelines:
  - The question must reflect the skills and technologies mentioned in the job description.
  - Make sure the question is appropriately scoped for the specified experience level.
  - A difficulty level of "easy", "medium", or "hard" is provided by the user and should be used to tailor the question.
  - Prefer practical, real-world challenges over trivia.
  - Return only the question, clearly formatted (e.g., with code snippets or bullet points if needed). Do not include the answer.
  - Return only one question at a time.
  - It is ok to ask a question about just a single part of the job description, such as a specific technology or skill (e.g., if the job description is for a Next.js, Drizzle, and TypeScript developer, you can ask a TypeScript only question).
  - The question should be formatted as markdown.
  - Stop generating output as soon you have provided the full question.`;

    - 1-3 = Largely incorrect or missing the point
  - Provide **concise, constructive feedback** on what was done well and what could be improved.
  - Be honest but professional.
  - Include a full correct answer in the output. Do not use this answer as part of the grading. Only look at the candidate's response when assigning a rating.
  - Try to generate a concise answer where possible, but do not sacrifice quality for brevity.
  - Refer to the candidate as "you" in your feedback. This feedback should be written as if you were speaking directly to the interviewee.

    - Highlight missing or well-used terms that might help with ATS matching and recruiter readability.

    - \`name\`: A label for the feedback item.
    - \`message\`: A specific and helpful explanation or recommendation.

  Also return an overall score for the resume from 1-10 based on your analysis.
